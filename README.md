# Skip Docs Site

This repo contains the generated static documentation site files, and is the source that feeds the Vercel hosted site. See the [docs-site](https://vercel.com/skiplabs-website/docs-site) project.

These files are generated and should not be modified directly, but instead should be regenerated after modifying the sources in skip/www, or the doc strings in the ts sources for API docs. See skip/www/README.md for instructions on modifying and publishing the documentation sources.
