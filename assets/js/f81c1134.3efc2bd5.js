What if you could actually see how data responds to change, in real time, right from your terminal?\\n\\nIn this tutorial, we walk through building a small proof-of-concept social network backend using [Skip](https://www.skiplabs.io/) and TypeScript. It tracks users, groups, and their friendships\u2014with automatic updates to \\"active friends\\" using Skip\u2019s reactive computation graph.\\n\\nYou\u2019ll learn how to:\\n\\n- Set up a reactive Skip service\\n- Define users and groups as live-updating resources\\n- Connect it all to a REST API using Express\\n- Observe real-time updates as the data evolves\\n\\n> \\"The simpler, the merrier\\" \u2014 this project keeps things minimal, focused, and easy to explore.\\n\\nFrom Alice adding a new friend to live data reactions, this guide makes reactive systems tangible.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n### The Simpler, the Better\\n\\nEver heard the saying, \\"The simpler, the better\\"? Well, that especially holds true when it comes to learning\u2014particularly in reactive programming. Think of it like what we expect from a social network: *reactivity* in response to change. Sure, a full-blown social network has more bells and whistles than a carnival, but here we\'re just tackling a small piece of it. This guide keeps things light and breezy, focusing on the essentials to show how to build a reactive system using **Skip**. It\'s a proof of concept.\\n\\nBy keeping things simple and working right in the terminal, we can easily follow how data flows and how changes propagate without getting lost in complexity.\\n\\nWe\'ll start by setting up a Node project with TypeScript. Then, we\'ll define our data types. Since this is a social network, we want to represent friends and determine if they\'re active in a given group. We\'ll define members with names and associated groups, and for each group, we\'ll track whether a given member is active. After that, we\'ll build the Skip service, and finally, we\'ll wrap things up with a web server that uses the reactive service. All this will be wrapped up in an example where Alice makes a new friend.\\n\\nYou can follow along with [the full code on GitHub](https://github.com/SkipLabs/reactive_social_network_service_poc), structured with a commit for each step:\\n\\n### Step 1: The TypeScript Project\\n\\nThe whole first step can be found [here on GitHub](https://github.com/SkipLabs/reactive_social_network_service_poc/commit/b424165666b45a9d17b969f2422941f748556c85).\\n\\nThis first project really is Basic TypeScript 101, but watch out for some details such as the configuration of `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`. These two files can be sneaky little configuration traps if you\'re not careful. They might seem straightforward, but trust me, they can trip you up when you least expect it. So, keep an eye out and make sure everything is set up just right.\\n\\nLet\'s create a directory for this proof-of-concept:\\n\\n```bash\\nmkdir reactive_social_network_service\\ncd reactive_social_network_service\\n```\\n\\nAnd now the TypeScript project:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm init -y\\nnpm install --save-dev typescript @types/node\\nmkdir -p src\\nnpx tsc --init \\\\\\n    --target ES2022 \\\\\\n    --module nodenext \\\\\\n    --rootDir \\"./src\\" \\\\\\n    --outDir \\"./dist\\" \\\\\\n    --moduleResolution nodenext\\n```\\n\\nConfiguration of `package.json` to prepare the project for what\'s about to come:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm pkg set type=\\"module\\"\\nnpm pkg set scripts.build=\\"tsc\\"\\nnpm pkg set scripts.start=\\"node dist/index.js\\"\\nnpm pkg set scripts.clean=\\"rm -rf dist node_modules\\"\\n```\\n\\nWe are now ready to enter the Skip world!\\n\\n### Step 2: The Skip Service\\n\\nThe whole second step can be found [here on GitHub](https://github.com/SkipLabs/reactive_social_network_service_poc/commit/a63289aaae2404e62d1d212d870be042ab47f3e5).\\n\\nWe are going to need SkipLabs packages:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm add @skiplabs/skip\\n```\\n\\nSo you better understand where we are heading, here is what the source directory will eventually look like:\\n\\n```bash\\nsrc\\n    activefriends.mts\\n    data.mts\\n    index.ts\\n    skipservice.mts\\n    types.mts\\n```\\n\\nAnd we start with the necessary types. In a nutshell, Skip defines a resource as the output of a Skip service. A resource is updated and maintained reactively. A collection is the core data structure over which reactive computations operate. An `EagerCollection` is always kept up-to-date. `LazyCollection` exists as well for evaluation upon queries only, but we are not using them in this proof-of-concept.\\n\\nHere the code for `src/types.mts`:\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport {\\n    type EagerCollection,\\n} from \\"@skipruntime/core\\";\\n\\ntype UserID = number;\\ntype GroupID = number;\\ntype User = { name: string; active?: boolean; friends: UserID[] };\\ntype Group = { name: string; members: UserID[] };\\n\\ntype ServiceInputs = {\\n    users: EagerCollection<UserID, User>;\\n    groups: EagerCollection<GroupID, Group>;\\n};\\n\\ntype ResourceInputs = {\\n    users: EagerCollection<UserID, User>;\\n    activeMembers: EagerCollection<GroupID, UserID>;\\n};\\n\\nexport type {\\n    UserID,\\n    GroupID,\\n    User,\\n    Group,\\n    ServiceInputs,\\n    ResourceInputs,\\n};\\n```\\n\\nNow some data to get started. Outside this proof-of-concept, this would come from your database.\\n\\nFour users and two groups e.g. Carol is in both groups but inactive.\\n\\nHere is the code for `src/data.mts`:\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport { InitialData } from \\"@skipruntime/core\\";\\nimport { ServiceInputs } from \\"./types.mjs\\";\\n\\n// Initial data for the social network service\\nconst initialData: InitialData<ServiceInputs> = {\\n    users: [\\n        [0, [{ name: \\"Bob\\", active: true, friends: [1, 2] }]],\\n        [1, [{ name: \\"Alice\\", active: true, friends: [0, 2] }]],\\n        [2, [{ name: \\"Carol\\", active: false, friends: [0, 1] }]],\\n        [3, [{ name: \\"Eve\\", active: true, friends: [] }]],\\n    ],\\n    groups: [\\n        [1001, [{ name: \\"Group 1\\", members: [1, 2, 3] }]],\\n        [1002, [{ name: \\"Group 2\\", members: [0, 2] }]],\\n    ],\\n};\\n\\nexport { initialData };\\n```\\n\\nLet\'s talk about active friends! For that, we need to define a filter for that `active` boolean. We are going to use a mapper. In Skip, a mapper describes a computation from keys/values in one collection to keys/values in another collection. It forms the edges of the Skip reactive computation graph, specifying transformations and compositions of data to produce intermediate results and outputs.\\n\\nWe are defining two mappers and a resource: one mapper to retrieve active members out of a given group, one mapper to retrieve friends of a given user out of a given group, and a resource which will hold active friends for a given user.\\n\\nHere is the code for `src/activefriends.mts`:\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport {\\n    type EagerCollection,\\n    type Json,\\n    type Mapper,\\n    type Resource,\\n    type Values,\\n} from \\"@skipruntime/core\\";\\n\\nimport { GroupID, Group, UserID, User, ResourceInputs } from \\"./types.mjs\\";\\n\\n// Mapper functions for reactive data transformations\\nclass ActiveMembers implements Mapper<GroupID, Group, GroupID, UserID> {\\n    constructor(private users: EagerCollection<UserID, User>) { }\\n\\n    // Maps group members to active users only\\n    mapEntry(gid: GroupID, group: Values<Group>): Iterable<[GroupID, UserID]> {\\n        return group\\n            .getUnique()\\n            .members.flatMap((uid: UserID) =>\\n                this.users.getUnique(uid).active ? [[gid, uid]] : [],\\n            );\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n// Filters group members to only include friends of a specific user\\nclass FilterFriends implements Mapper<GroupID, UserID, GroupID, UserID> {\\n    constructor(private readonly user: User) { }\\n\\n    mapEntry(gid: GroupID, uids: Values<UserID>): Iterable<[GroupID, UserID]> {\\n        return uids\\n            .toArray()\\n            .flatMap((uid: UserID) => (this.user.friends.includes(uid) ? [[gid, uid]] : []));\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n// Resource that provides active friends for a given user\\nclass ActiveFriends implements Resource<ResourceInputs> {\\n    private readonly uid: UserID;\\n\\n    constructor(params: Json) {\\n        if (typeof params != \\"number\\")\\n            throw new Error(\\"Missing required number parameter \'uid\'\\");\\n        this.uid = params;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Creates a collection of active friends for the specified user\\n    instantiate(inputs: ResourceInputs): EagerCollection<GroupID, UserID> {\\n        const user = inputs.users.getUnique(this.uid);\\n        return inputs.activeMembers.map(FilterFriends, user);\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nexport { ActiveMembers, ActiveFriends };\\n```\\n\\nAnd now the Skip service itself. It encompasses a server and a broker.\\n\\nHere is the code for `src/skipservice.mts`:\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport { runService } from \\"@skipruntime/server\\";\\nimport { SkipServiceBroker } from \\"@skipruntime/helpers\\";\\n\\nimport { ResourceInputs, ServiceInputs } from \\"./types.mjs\\";\\nimport { initialData } from \\"./data.mjs\\";\\nimport { ActiveFriends, ActiveMembers } from \\"./activefriends.mjs\\";\\n\\n// Service configuration and reactive graph definition\\nconst service = {\\n    initialData,\\n    resources: { active_friends: ActiveFriends },\\n    // Creates the reactive data flow graph\\n    createGraph(input: ServiceInputs): ResourceInputs {\\n        const users = input.users;\\n        const activeMembers = input.groups.map(ActiveMembers, users);\\n        return { users, activeMembers };\\n    },\\n};\\n\\n// Start the reactive service with specified ports\\nconst server = await runService(service, {\\n    streaming_port: 8080,\\n    control_port: 8081,\\n});\\n\\n// Initialize the service broker for client communication\\nconst serviceBroker = new SkipServiceBroker({\\n    host: \\"localhost\\",\\n    control_port: 8081,\\n    streaming_port: 8080,\\n});\\n\\nexport { server, serviceBroker };\\n```\\n\\n### Step 3: The Server\\n\\nThe whole first step can be found [here on GitHub](https://github.com/SkipLabs/reactive_social_network_service_poc/commit/5fb3308540468243eeb10972d2ace887d5d3678b).\\n\\nTo use the Skip service, we are creating an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install express\\nnpm install --save-dev @types/express\\n```\\n\\nThis server will expose an API to monitor active friends, and modify users and groups.\\n\\nHere is the code for `src/index.ts`:\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport express, { Request, Response } from \\"express\\";\\nimport { server, serviceBroker } from \\"./skipservice.mjs\\";\\n\\n// Initialize Express app\\nconst app = express();\\napp.use(express.json());\\n\\n// Store a reference to the Express server\\nconst expressServer = app.listen(8082, () => {\\n    console.log(`Web server listening at port 8082`);\\n});\\n\\n// Utility function to handle errors\\nconst handleError = (res: Response, error: unknown) => {\\n    console.error(\\"Error: \\", error);\\n    res.status(500).json(error);\\n};\\n\\n// Route handlers\\nconst getActiveFriends = async (req: Request, res: Response) => {\\n    try {\\n        const uuid = await serviceBroker.getStreamUUID(\\"active_friends\\", Number(req.params.uid));\\n        res.redirect(301, `http://localhost:8080/v1/streams/${uuid}`);\\n    } catch (error) {\\n        handleError(res, error);\\n    }\\n};\\n\\nconst updateEntity = async (entity: string, idParam: string, req: Request, res: Response) => {\\n    try {\\n        const id = Number(req.params[idParam]);\\n        await serviceBroker.update(entity, [[id, [req.body]]]);\\n        res.status(200).json({});\\n    } catch (error) {\\n        handleError(res, error);\\n    }\\n};\\n\\n// Define routes\\napp.get(\\"/active_friends/:uid\\", getActiveFriends);\\napp.put(\\"/users/:uid\\", (req: Request, res: Response) => updateEntity(\\"users\\", \\"uid\\", req, res));\\napp.put(\\"/groups/:gid\\", (req: Request, res: Response) => updateEntity(\\"groups\\", \\"gid\\", req, res));\\n\\n// Graceful shutdown handler for:\\n// - SIGINT: Ctrl+C in terminal\\n// - SIGTERM: System termination requests (kill command, container orchestration, etc.)\\n[\\"SIGTERM\\", \\"SIGINT\\"].forEach((sig) => process.on(sig, async () => {\\n    await server.close();\\n    expressServer.close(() => {\\n        console.log(\\"\\\\nServers shut down.\\");\\n    });\\n}));\\n```\\n\\nLet\'s install, build and start it!\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install\\nnpm run build\\nnpm run start\\n```\\n\\nStarting the server will display something like:\\n\\n```bash\\n> reactive_social_network_service@1.0.0 start\\n> node dist/index.js\\n\\nSkip control service listening on port 8081\\nSkip streaming service listening on port 8080\\nWeb server listening at port 8082\\n```\\n\\nThe Express server listens to the steaming service for updates, and it is now time see it in action!\\n\\n### Step 4: Let\'s See It Work\\n\\nWe are going to use three terminals: one is already running the server and the service, one will issue writes on port 8081, and one will watch changes on port 8082.\\n\\nWhile the service is running, in a fresh terminal, we are going to listen for changes on Alice\'s friends (index `1`):\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl -LN http://localhost:8082/active_friends/1 # Alice\'s active friends\\n```\\n\\nThe previous command will continue listening after displaying the following, hence you won\'t get any prompt back.\\n\\n```bash\\nevent: init\\nid: <SOME_HASH>\\ndata: [[1002,[0]]]\\n```\\n\\nLeave it like that and open the third and last terminal in which we are going to add and remove values to the initial data: the list of Alice friends is about to evolve:\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl http://localhost:8081/v1/inputs/users \\\\\\n    -X PATCH \\\\\\n    --json \'[[1, [\\n    {\\n        \\"name\\": \\"Alice\\",\\n        \\"active\\": true,\\n        \\"friends\\": [0, 2, 3]\\n        }\\n    ]]]\'\\n```\\n\\nWhat do you see in the second terminal? The data is being reactively updated. Go ahead and try other modifications e.g. Bob turns inactive, Alice removes Carol from her group of friends.\\n\\n### Wrapping Up\\n\\nReactive programming doesn\'t have to be intimidating. With Skip, we\'ve seen how simple it is to wire up reactivity\u2014from raw data all the way to live updates in an API. The idea is simple: when something changes, everything that depends on it updates automatically. And that\'s exactly what we built.\\n\\nOf course, this is just the beginning. You now have a foundation for reactive services, and from here, the possibilities are wide open. Want to plug it into a real-time dashboard? Hook it into a game? Build collaborative tools?\\n\\n### What\'s next?\\n\\nFor the next Skip article, what should I tackle first? You tell me!\\n\\n- Listening to live changes from a PostgreSQL database?\\n- Scaling your Skip service horizontally?\\n- Integrating with frontend frameworks like React?\\n- Managing authorization and privacy per user?\\n- What else would be useful to your projects?\\n\\nWe\'ve exposed reactive programming in the nude, \'scuse my french.

Cloud native applications are inherently distributed and have become popular as developers are drawn to the convenience of containers and platform-as-a-service infrastructure.\\n\\nThe API-ification of important subsystems means today hardly anyone would consider implementing their own payments, shipping, SMS, chat, billing or shopping cart functionality.  Instead they\u2019ll lean on Stripe, Twilio, Shopify, Shippo, etc; accelerating time-to-value and further distributing the functions of the application.\\n\\nIn the last few years developers have moved quickly to incorporate more and diverse AI features into their applications, but AI models and application logic compute requirements are quite different from one another and therefore seldom run in the same stack, further distributing the application.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n![Example architecture diagram](./assets/event-hidden-arch-diagram.png)\\n\\nSome have called for a \u201cback to basics\u201d approach of a single stack or modular monolith, but given the list of external demands on modern application development, distributed is unlikely to go away.  Instead it\u2019s becoming a more common approach for application architectures, not less, especially for \u201csuccessful\u201d applications that need to modularize to support more customers, users and features.\\n\\n### 10 years of bad advice\\n\\nOne can sympathize with the desire for a \u201cback to basics\u201d approach to cloud-native applications.  There are many \u201cpros\u201d to writing cloud-native, distributed applications but living with them has been miserable for developers and operators alike.  \u201cCloud native\u201d is effectively synonymous with \u201cdistributed,\u201d and \u201cdistributed\u201d is another way to say a network is parked in the middle of the application.  This changes engineering and operations in many big and subtle ways.  The most common and questionable advice to tackle these challenges has been \u201cevent-driven.\u201d\\n\\n![Events everywhere buzz lightyear](./assets/event-hidden-arch-buzz.png)\\n\\nEvents are the biggest reason why engineering teams try to postpone distributed or microservice architectures for as long as possible.  \u201cCloud native\u201d and \u201cmicroservices\u201d have unwittingly become synonymous with \u201cevent-driven\u201d and sullied their reputations in the process.\\n\\nEvents remain a useful technical mechanism to transmit state and data among application resources but they are a miserable experience for developers and operators alike.  Events:\\n\\n- Put application state and data in dozens of queues that make the application prone to failures, race conditions and incorrect results\\n- Force developers to think and program asynchronously which is more complex and time consuming than synchronous code\\n- Require developers know more than just their portion of the code and application domain: they also need to understand how to work with queues, caches and event schemas\\n- Make applications difficult to troubleshoot as there is no one place to understand the state and data for an application\\n\\n![Revolution against API schemas](./assets/event-hidden-arch-revolution.png)\\n\\n###  ~~Event-driven~~ vs event-hidden\\n\\nThe event-driven approach *was* necessary in 2020 but it isn\u2019t any longer in 2025\\\\.  Today\u2019s modern abstractions ensure it\u2019s unnecessary to make a faustian bargain between the flexibility & scale of distributed and the existential dread inspired by event-driven architectures.\\n\\nThere are three innovations that together allow us to engineer applications as event-driven but where developers and operators are fully abstracted away from the events themselves.\\n\\n1. [React](https://react.dev/) paired with client state management frameworks like [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [Xstate](https://xstate.js.org/) or [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) create a simple, productive experience for frontend engineering.  Frontend engineers are able to implement simple, performant UI components that can support complex application behaviors while outsourcing state and DOM management to the framework.\\n\\n2. Durable execution systems like [Temporal](https://temporal.io/), [Restate](https://restate.dev/) and [DBOS](https://www.dbos.dev/) ensure distributed backend application writes are always correct within and across services and network boundaries because each function call is durable by default.  All of the convenient guarantees of an ACID transaction are injected into the everyday programming experience.\\n\\n3. Reactive frameworks for incremental computation like [Skip](https://github.com/SkipLabs/skip) make it simple to implement distributed application reads from multiple sources and latencies to disparate clients and views.  Developers can blend data from multiple REST and/or streaming sources but write their logic as simple map functions free from references to infrastructure or events.  Because the services are reactive, performance and correctness concerns like cache invalidations are outsourced to the framework.\\n\\nAll three technologies share many of the same design principles.  Each technology caters to a different area of the application (client changes, backend writes, backend reads) but they all:\\n\\n- Provide a declarative developer experiences free from references to infrastructure\\n- Are event-driven \u201cunder the covers\u201d but don\u2019t leak these details to users\\n- Work asynchronously, supporting high levels of concurrency but still make the developer experience feel effectively synchronous\\n- Manage and in some cases enforce immutability of functions and/or data\\n- Handle application state as a first class concern\\n- Allow for modularity and incremental adoption \\\\- they don\u2019t enforce \u201cone pure approach\u201d on an entire application\\n- Can run locally or globally\\n- Are open source\\n\\nCollectively, these frameworks provide a substantial upgrade to applications across developer experience, feature velocity, correctness, efficiency and operational reliability.  Software development returns to a simpler, low context model; developers do not need to learn the unique quirks of low level infrastructure or understand the overall application architecture just to build or enhance their part of the application.\\n\\n### New powers\\n\\nBurying events doesn\u2019t just simplify engineering, it grants engineers with new powers in the process.\\n\\n**Transparency**\\n\\nIronically, with event-hidden engineering, every behavior of the application is now more visible in an actionable way because events are held in lower layers of the stack that understand their semantics and context.\\n\\n**State Handling**\\n\\nEvents are not the only thing that get hidden.  By extension state handling, state changes and their implications for correctness are also buried in this new model.

the collection `myTable` will update incrementally the same as any other Skip collection and can be used in reactive computations combining multiple tables or any other Skip collection.\\n\\nAlthough the `key` column specified here is the primary key column `id` of the table, it need not be a primary key or even unique -- it can be convenient to use a foreign key or other column to group multiple rows per key in the resulting Skip collection.\\n\\nA more-involved example of a reactive service with computations over several Postgres tables is available [here](https://github.com/SkipLabs/skip/tree/main/examples/hackernews).\\n\\n## Kafka\\n\\nApache [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) is another backend component with widespread adoption for high-throughput messaging and event streaming, often used to power real-time features.\\n\\nIntegrating a Kafka cluster with a Skip service is a natural way to build reactive logic on top of streaming data.\\nAs such, we provide an ExternalService [adapter](https://skiplabs.io/docs/api/adapters/kafka/classes/KafkaExternalService) which handles the plumbing for you and abstracts Kafka message streams as Skip collections.\\n\\nFirst, specify connection information and configuration in the `externalServices` field of your service:\\n\\n```typescript\\nconst service = {\\n  initialData: ...,\\n  resources: ...,\\n  createGraph: ...,\\n  externalServices: {\\n    kafka: new KafkaExternalService({ clientId, brokers, ... }),\\n    ...,\\n  },\\n}\\n```\\n\\nthen, consume messages into a reactive collection with a `usExternalResource` call, e.g.\\n\\n```typescript\\nconst myKafkaTopic: EagerCollection<string, string> =\\n  context.useExternalResource({\\n    service: \\"kafka\\",\\n    identifier: \\"my-kafka-topic\\",\\n    params: {},\\n  });\\n```\\n\\nBy default, messages are interpreted as their string key and value, but a \\"`messageProcessor`\\" can be provided to parse message payloads into other types, manipulate key structure, or pull in \\"topic\\" identifiers or other message metadata.\\n\\n\\n## Other external APIs\\n\\nOf course, there are many other technologies and systems and you may need to integrate those with Skip.\\nThe simplest option for many non-reactive APIs is to periodically poll an HTTP endpoint; we provide a simple interface to specify a polled dependency on a non-reactive API:\\n\\n```typescript\\nconst service = {\\n  initialData: ...\\n  resources: ...\\n  createGraph: ...\\n  externalServices: {\\n    myExternalService: new PolledExternalService({\\n      my_resource: {\\n        // HTTP endpoint\\n        url: \\"https://api.example.com/my_resource\\",\\n        // Polling interval, in milliseconds\\n        interval: 5000,\\n        // data processing into `Entry<K, V>[]` key/values structure\\n        conv: (data: Json) => Array.from(data, (v, k) => [k, [v]])\\n      }\\n    }),\\n  },\\n};\\n```\\n\\nThis [`PolledExternalService`](https://skiplabs.io/docs/api/helpers/classes/PolledExternalService) specifies a single endpoint polled every 5 seconds, but in general can include any number of endpoints with different polling intervals and converter/parser functions.\\n\\nOf course, polling necessarily introduces some latency in the reactive service: data can become stale between polls.\\nOn the other hand, increasing the request frequency can place undue load on the target non-reactive API.\\nAs such, care should be taken when setting up a polled dependency to choose a reasonable interval, and where possible polling should be avoided in favor of genuinely reactive updates.\\n\\n\\n## What\'s next?\\n\\nThese three adapters ([`PostgresExternalService`](https://skiplabs.io/docs/api/adapters/postgres/classes/PostgresExternalService), [`KafkaExternalService`](https://skiplabs.io/docs/api/adapters/kafka/classes/KafkaExternalService), and [`PolledExternalService`](https://skiplabs.io/docs/api/helpers/classes/PolledExternalService)) are provided to make it easy to integrate with common backend systems, but all three are built using only public APIs and can easily be extended or tweaked in user code.\\n\\nIf your application would benefit from additional adapters for other components and technologies, you can implement an [`ExternalService`](https://skiplabs.io/docs/api/core/interfaces/ExternalService) to wrap non-reactive systems as inputs to your Skip service.\\n\\nWe welcome and support open-source contributions and feature requests and are always happy to answer questions or help out on Discord."},{"id":"skiplabs-funding","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/skiplabs-funding","source":"@site/blog/skiplabs_funding.md","title":"SkipLabs Funding","description":"SkipLabs raises $8M in seed funding","date":"2025-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":2.435,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Julien Verlaguet","title":"SkipLabs Founder & CEO","url":"https://x.com/JulienVerlaguet","key":"jverlaguet","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"SkipLabs Funding","description":"SkipLabs raises $8M in seed funding","slug":"skiplabs-funding","date":"2025-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","authors":"jverlaguet"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"New built-in resources for Skip services","permalink":"/blog/non-reactive-dependencies"},"nextItem":{"title":"Why Skip?","permalink":"/blog/why-skip"}},"content":"**The News**\\n\\nWe\u2019re pleased to announce that SkipLabs has raised $8 million to bring incremental computing to applications everywhere.

I eventually decided to leave Facebook (now Meta) to build on the work of Hack and Skiplang and develop technologies that would address the same challenges we had at Facebook but for engineers generally.  To do this, SkipLabs needed to incorporate two new technologies to make the work we did at Facebook usable in a normal engineering context.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n1. A way to manage objects transactionally as their state changes\\n\\nThis is an essential and unique design choice in Skip\u2019s approach to incremental computation.  Without it, developers have to program against streams and assume a large and insidiously subtle amount of complexity.  Incremental computation will only become mainstream if the dev and ops time experience is simpler and easier than the more common request/response paradigm, not just faster & continuous.\\n\\nObject handling needed to go beyond simple caching.  We needed an in-memory system of objects and collections that could maintain an up-to-date view of the data as it changed which we call \\\\*\\\\*reactive collections\\\\*\\\\*.\\n\\nMost of the objects in a program can be managed with memoization: storing and reusing the results of expensive computations.  This can be fast, simple and efficient provided you know when to evict the memoized values.\\n\\nIn Skip, memoized objects are held in \u201cLazy Collections.\u201d They compute and cache results only when needed clients and will automatically evict data from the cache to save memory.\\n\\nOther objects serve as indices or dictionaries. These objects realistically cannot be memoized as every value in the dictionary needs to be up to date at all times.  Skip manages these objects as \u201cEager Collections,\u201d keeping them in memory at all times and recomputing whenever a source updates.\\n\\n![Skip runtime internals diagram](./assets/why_skip_runtime_diagram.png)\\n\\n2. An ability to program services that compute incrementally but in familiar languages.\\n\\nSkiplang was built from the ground up to support incremental computing and it\u2019s very well suited to that purpose.  Realistically engineering teams outside of Meta have already picked their languages and stacks and it would be unrealistic to expect everyone to change to meet Skip.\\n\\nWe realized we could bring the most essential characteristics of Skiplang to already widely used languages, starting with TypeScript.  Skip aims to allow developers to implement programs declaratively while the framework automatically manages the state and decides what parts of the graph of computation need to be re-run.  For this to work, programs need to be deterministic, effect free and assume they are interacting with objects in a transactional heap.\\n\\n![Skip runtime application stack](./assets/why_skip_stack_diagram.png)\\n\\nThe Skip Runtime integrates with popular TypeScript runtimes (e.g. Node, Bun) and using proxy objects gives TypeScript a reactive, transactional heap.  We then added a TypeScript API that gives developers a simple programming model of map functions applied to the objects Skip is now holding in its transactional heap.  In this way, developers get to stick with their preferred language while Skip can transparently manage both the state of the objects and directs when different parts of a program are recomputed.\\n\\nWe added higher level features to the API to more easily manipulate those collections (filter, slice, join, etc ...), and added support for sub-collections (collections created while computing the entry of a collection), among other things.  In the future we think there\u2019s an opportunity to add other (optional) higher level primitives to make building complex services even easier.\\n\\nToday the Skip Framework exclusively supports TypeScript.  We plan to add support for Python and Java in the near future and other languages in the medium term.\\n\\n**The Skip Framework**\\n\\nBy combining a programming model that enforced effect-free operations on immutable objects with a runtime that abstracted away state and data management details, Skip has grown from a language to a full framework that we\u2019ve recently released.\\n\\n**Why Skip is useful**\\n\\nSkip can power services that perform any combination of reads and writes but the main benefits are experienced with reads.  Skip gives read-based features & functions several advantages over the more typical request/response model.\\n\\nSkip programs will:\\n\\nContinuously react to changes in data and clients \\\\- by managing the state of objects and the impact of functions on those objects, Skip services can incrementally recompute and stream new values to clients without recomputing unchanged values unnecessarily.\\n\\nAutomatically manage their own state \\\\- a feature may need to fetch data from multiple sources, compute intermediate results in a specific order while hydrating & invalidating different caches.  In Skip all of this complexity is handled by the framework.  Developers just write functions against collections for a single point in time.\\n\\nLet you introspect their execution \\\\- reactive programs are historically challenging to inspect and debug.  Because the Skip runtime manages both the objects and their graph of computation, Skip programs are very easy to introspect.  We plan to add a debugger to the framework to capitalize on this part of the design.\\n\\nWork alongside traditional request / response programs \\\\- Unlike past approaches to state management and reactivity, we wanted to make sure Skip was not an \u201call or nothing\u201d engineering decision.  Vertically, Skip can run in one or several layers of an existing software stack. It can read and write data from preexisting REST services, streaming sources or some legacy backend.  Skip can also power a new service where it reads and writes from a traditional database.\\n\\nHorizontally, Skip can power some or all the features of an application\u2019s backend and coexists with other business logic written in other frameworks, languages, etc.  Within Skip\u2019s context it\'s very easy to extend what you\u2019ve implemented in a service through a feature called \u201cmirroring\u201d that lets a new service import and synchronize data from a pre-existing peer service.\\n\\n**Why it feels awesome to use Skip**\\n\\nSkip lets developers focus on the \\"what\\" instead of the \\"how.\\" By defining the desired outcome declaratively, Skip generates the necessary logic to keep data live and reactive. It handles complexities like cache invalidation and recomputation efficiently without adding any cognitive burden for the developer.\\n\\nWe took a graph-based approach to the Skip programming model. You define your computation as a series of operations on collections, creating a \\\\*\\\\*graph of reactive computations\\\\*\\\\*. Each node in the graph can be a lazy or eager collection, and the framework automatically manages dependencies, updates, and cache invalidation for you.\\n\\nHere\u2019s the magic: You write your program as if \\\\*\\\\*time is frozen\\\\*\\\\*, defining static outputs in terms of static inputs.  Skip then turns this into a live, streaming system. If an input changes, the framework efficiently propagates updates to the affected parts of the graph, ensuring everything stays consistent. It even supports transactional updates, so you can modify multiple inputs simultaneously without breaking consistency.\\n\\nThis approach not only makes building incremental features easier but also scales better as the system grows. By focusing on what you want to build and letting Skip handle the rest, developers can deliver live, interactive features without the typical headaches.\\n\\n**Why Skip matters**\\n\\nSkip isn\u2019t just about solving caching or problems of incremental computation, it\u2019s about rethinking how we build systems that deal with constantly changing data. By giving developers tools to handle immutability, caching, and reactivity seamlessly, Skip makes it easier to write reliable, efficient, fast and scalable applications.\\n\\nBy combining the lessons learned from Facebook\u2019s early challenges with the innovation of Skip, we\u2019ve charted a path toward solving some of the most complex problems in real-time and reactive systems. This is just the beginning, and we\u2019re excited to see where this journey takes us next."},{"id":"skips-origins","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/skips-origins","source":"@site/blog/skips_origins.md","title":"Skip\'s Origins","description":"Describe the origins of the Skip framework and programming language.","date":"2025-02-11T12:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":4.495,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Julien Verlaguet","title":"SkipLabs Founder & CEO","url":"https://x.com/JulienVerlaguet","key":"jverlaguet","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Skip\'s Origins","description":"Describe the origins of the Skip framework and programming language.","slug":"skips-origins","date":"2025-02-11T12:00:00.000Z","authors":"jverlaguet"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Why Skip?","permalink":"/blog/why-skip"},"nextItem":{"title":"Skip alpha","permalink":"/blog/skip-alpha"}},"content":"**Coping with success**\\n\\nI joined a much-smaller-than-today\u2019s Facebook in 2011 to work on what would eventually become the developer tools team. At the time I joined, the engineering team was in the hundreds and the tools we had for development were, well, not great. PHP was the backbone of almost everything, with millions of lines of code. JavaScript was secondary, and only a few critical services ran on other languages. The company was scaling rapidly, and our development practices weren\u2019t keeping up.\\n\\nAs the codebase grew, so did the difficulty of maintaining and improving it.  Facebook became much more feature rich and simple enhancements became complicated and error prone.  Often new features needed to operate conditionally on how other preexisting features were already operating.  Essentially with each new layer of features teams added, state management became a greater concern.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n**Power of type systems**\\n\\nFacebook\u2019s codebase relied heavily on dynamic constructs called \u201cgatekeepers\u201d that determined which features were live for which users under different conditions. But these gatekeepers could change which code paths were executed in ways that weren\u2019t always obvious during development.\\n\\nThe inability to recreate the state of a path made testing and refactoring a nightmare. Imagine this: you tweak a method, and three weeks later, you\u2019re woken up at 3 AM because your change broke something deep in the application. Over time developers stopped touching critical parts of the codebase. Instead of refactoring and improving existing code, they\u2019d build parallel versions\u2014hacks on top of hacks. The technical debt was piling up, and we needed a way to make changes safely and confidently.\\n\\nWe believed we could use types to make deeper static analysis and automatic refactoring possible in the PHP language and this would help engineers bring some order to the chaos.  The system was called Hack. Adoption wasn\u2019t immediate\u2014there was some resistance\u2014but over time, developers saw the value. We intentionally designed the type system to be more flexible than strictly \u201ccorrect.\u201d This decision allowed us to cover more of the codebase quickly, even if it meant making some trade-offs in precision. It worked. Hack became the default way to write PHP at Facebook, and it\u2019s still in use today.\\n\\n**Incrementality**\\n\\nAs Facebook applications grew denser and more layered, more teams were looking to add real-time features where users\u2019 actions immediately impact others, like clicking a \\"Like\\" button and instantly updating the count across everyone\u2019s apps.  Such features are essential because performance and interactivity grew user engagement. When an application feels fresh and interactive, it\u2019s much more appealing than static content. However, implementing this in a scalable way is not straightforward.\\n\\nA typical scenario: you fetch a Facebook post. Normally, the server retrieves data like the post\u2019s text, the number of likes, and the comments. It applies rules to filter and prioritize what\u2019s shown (e.g., highlighting the most relevant comments or enforcing privacy settings). This logic runs once and produces a static result\u2014the post you see on your screen.\\n\\n![Non-reactive request flow](./assets/skips_origins_nonreactive_flow.png)\\n\\nMaking this \\"live\\" means the post updates automatically. If someone likes it, the count changes instantly. If a comment gets edited or deleted, it reflects for everyone in real time. Achieving this requires \\"inverting the arrow.\\"  Traditionally, a user\u2019s actions\u2014like adding a comment\u2014 produces a write to the database. To make things reactive, engineers needed to turn these writes into continuous streams of updates. For example:\\n\\n1\\\\. **User likes a post** \u2192 Create a stream of updates for that post\u2019s like count.\\n2\\\\. **User adds a comment** \u2192 Create a stream for the comments section.\\n\\n![Reactive request flow](./assets/skips_origins_reactive_flow.png)\\n\\nTypically reactive frameworks compose these streams into live updates. While conceptually straightforward, this approach fell short because:\\n\\n**Excessive recomputations**: Each small change could require recalculating the entire post, which is expensive and inefficient.\\n\\n**Caching problems**: To compute incrementally but avoid excessive fetching and recomputation, you need caches. But managing caches as objects are mutated becomes a nightmare\u2014how do you ensure they\u2019re up-to-date without introducing inconsistencies?\\n\\nCaches can work well for \\"hot\\" data\u2014frequently accessed data with a short lifespan. But outside this narrow use case, caching comes with trade-offs:\\n\\n1\\\\. **Long TTL (Time-to-Live)**: Keeps data in the cache longer, but risks showing stale or inconsistent data.\\n2\\\\. **Manual Invalidation**: Requires custom logic to invalidate caches when data changes. This is extremely error-prone and hard to maintain.\\n\\nFor large-scale systems like Facebook, neither approach was sustainable. We needed a better solution.\\n\\nWe created Skiplang to better serve our needs for better state management and real-time features & services.  We believed we could use our experience developing type systems to flip the way we think about reactive systems. Instead of starting with database writes and building logic from there, Skiplang let you:\\n\\n1\\\\. **Define the Desired Output**: Begin with what you want to build (e.g. a Facebook post).\\n2\\\\. **Use Declarative Rules**: Specify what data is needed and how it\u2019s combined.\\n\\nSkiplang was originally designed to handle incremental computation and caching, but its capabilities quickly expanded to address the needs of reactive features and efficient data handling.  We built Skiplang on the premise that **cached objects were immutable** \\\\- unchangeable once created. If we could guarantee that immutability, it would be easier to use static analysis of Skiplang\u2019s typed language to track dependencies and know exactly when to invalidate the cache and where to recompute.  Traditional programming languages didn\u2019t give us the tools to enforce these guarantees."},{"id":"skip-alpha","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/skip-alpha","source":"@site/blog/skip_alpha.md","title":"Skip alpha","description":"Announce the alpha release of Skip","date":"2024-12-24T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":0.645,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"SkipLabs Team","key":"skiplabsteam","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Skip alpha","description":"Announce the alpha release of Skip","slug":"skip-alpha","date":"2024-12-24T00:00:00.000Z","authors":"skiplabsteam"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Skip\'s Origins","permalink":"/blog/skips-origins"}},"content":"We\u2019re pleased to share the alpha release of the [Skip Framework](https://github.com/SkipLabs/skip), an open source (MIT license) system for building and running reactive backend services.\\n\\nSkip gives TypeScript developers a simple declarative way to implement and run read-mostly features and services that are performant, transparent and continuously updated.\\nThe framework handles all the complexities of state management, integrations and failure handling in the process.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\nYou can install via:\\n\\n```\\nnpm i @skiplabs/skip\\n```\\n\\nThis is an alpha release \\\\- we are happy with its stability and functionality but are looking forward to feedback on the interfaces and developer experience.\\n\\nIf you have time to check it out over the holidays and have feedback or just questions, [come talk to us in discord](https://discord.gg/4dMEBA46mE).\\n\\nHappy holidays,\\n\\nThe SkipLabs team"}]}}')}}]);
